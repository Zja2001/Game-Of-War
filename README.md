# Game-Of-War

The way that the program works is that is made up of 7 different stacks that passes a number of cards based of how it progresses 
\n
Stacks: 
1) inital main deck of 52 cards

2) player deck

3) computer deck

4) player discard pile

5) computer discard pile

6) player war set up

7) computer war set up 


The program then compares the number value of the cards to determone the winner and the winner of the round keeps his card and the computer player's card and puts them into the repsective discard pile until the need to shuffle the discard pile into the respective main deck.
